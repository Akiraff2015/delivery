For taking part of a small Web Application being built purely in PHP/Object Oriented, MySQL, RESTful Service. Delivery Service System (still did not decided what to call yet), is an application where users can post a list of items that they want to buy for another person. It is a P2P Business Model, where people will exchange service and goods.

Here is a list of stuffs that are required to do:
* Frontend Design
* Refactoring code login, register and logout functions
* Move from mysqli to PDO
* Safe escape all characters from $_POST from user input
* Setup a mysql file for setup database for initial start
* Create a Delivery User Table
